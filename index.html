      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>Only 21% of residential recyclables are being recycled in the U.S., with 76% lost to household trash despite 73% of households having access to recycling services. Although many people have access to these services, they are often unused because of the incorrect belief that a single person recycling does not affect the overall health of our planet.</p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Key Statistics:</strong>
        <ul>
=          <li>43% of households participate in recycling</li>
          <li>Most recyclable materials (cardboard, cans, bottles) are under-recycled</li>
          <li>Seven out of ten cardboard boxes, three out of four milk jugs, four out of five steel cans, three out of four tons of mixed paper, and seven out of ten glass, aluminum cans, and PET bottles are lost to trash in homes.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Why Recycling Matters</h2>
      <p>Recycling between 2020 and 2050 will reduce emissions by 5.5 to 6.02 gigatons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to taking over one billion cars off the streets for one year!</p>
      <p>It also contributes economically: 681,000 jobs, $37.8B in wages, and $5.5B in tax revenue (2020 REI Report).</p>
      <p>Every bottle recycled is a step towards a cleaner planet. Recycle today!</p>
